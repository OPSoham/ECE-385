# ECE-385

Course Overview
"ECE 385 laboratory is required for both Electrical and Computer Engineering students. The laboratory exercises are designed to give students ability to design, build, and debug digital systems. The first two labs use standard discrete logic chips, wires and a protoboard. The rest of the course uses EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools to synthesize logic described in SystemVerilog to be implemented and mapped to an FPGA. The System-on-Chip (SoC) is also introduced."


Academic Integrity Reminder

"Put it in simple words, except for consultation on the abstract knowledge, every other aspect of an assignment submission has to be solely the work of the student(s).  No materialized solution should be used in the submission of any assignment without the consent from the instructors or the teaching assistants."- ECE 385 Wiki (https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ECE385SP22/Course+Overview+and+Policies)
