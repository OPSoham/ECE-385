# ECE-385

Course Overview
"ECE 385 laboratory is required for both Electrical and Computer Engineering students. The laboratory exercises are designed to give students ability to design, build, and debug digital systems. The first two labs use standard discrete logic chips, wires and a protoboard. The rest of the course uses EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools to synthesize logic described in SystemVerilog to be implemented and mapped to an FPGA. The System-on-Chip (SoC) is also introduced."
